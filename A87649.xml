            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The good God guide the hands of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the hearts of people to thoÅ¿e wayes which are firÅ¿t pure, and then peaceable: that thoÅ¿e Plants which are of Gods planting may be cheriÅ¿ht, and thoÅ¿e which are not may be rooted up. The love which I bear to truth, and the Å¿ervice I owe to thoÅ¿e that are willing to take paines to finde it: hath made me take this familiar way of CatechiÅ¿me to help them; which that they may reap the benefit of, I muÅ¿t earneÅ¿tly intreat them, in the peruÅ¿all of the alleadged Scriptures, to take notice not only of the words, but alÅ¿o of the Å¿cope of the holy GhoÅ¿t in them; without which they will fall Å¿hort of that

Å¿atisfaction which they might attain. You may make experiment how advantagious this courÅ¿e is, if you turne to the queÅ¿tion concerning Rebaptizing, and finde that in the Scripture there cited, <hi>Acts 19.</hi> (which place hath much exerciÅ¿ed the judgement of the learned) the Å¿cope of the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Paul</hi> is to Å¿how that the DiÅ¿ciples, who were long before bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed (though Å¿till they were Å¿o unable to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith, as that they had not Å¿o much as heard whether there were any holy GhoÅ¿t; nor could well tell unto what they were baptized: yet) ought not to be baptized againe; for as much as they were baptized in the name of JeÅ¿us, which he makes good to them from the Doctrine of <hi>John</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t, who taught repentance and faith in ChriÅ¿t. One thing more I muÅ¿t acquaint you with, which is, that divers particulars which might be here expected, I have pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poÅ¿ely omitted, having already Å¿poken to them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther TreatiÅ¿e intituled <hi>A Scripture CatechiÅ¿m for the times,</hi> to which I referre you for Å¿atisfaction; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iring you to improve your Talent in the Å¿ame deÅ¿igne with me, which is, to build the Å¿afety of perÅ¿ons on the foundation of truth. I Å¿hall conclude with the encouraging concluÅ¿ion of the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>James, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if any of you do erre from the truth, and one convert him, let him know, that he which converteth the Å¿inner from the errour of his way, Å¿hall Å¿ave a Å¿oule from death, and Å¿hall hide a multitude of Å¿ins.</hi>

Some few yeers Å¿ince, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the new Opinions that now have Å¿eized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many, were firÅ¿t repreÅ¿ented to me, and I Å¿aw them entertained by Å¿ome perÅ¿ons that were preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in my thoughts, and managed by Å¿uch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as at the firÅ¿t Å¿ight Å¿eemed to carry Å¿trength with them: I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e I beganne to Å¿tagger thereat: whereupon for my own Å¿atisfaction I was inquiÅ¿itive after Å¿uch TreatiÅ¿es on all hands as wrote either for or againÅ¿t them; which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention, that I may give you an account of what experience hath taught me; namely; that there is more Å¿atisfaction to be gained by a diligent weighing of Å¿ome one Scripture, then by reading over many other books; for, indeed, the Scripture is the Å¿upreme judge of controverÅ¿ies; and all that the ableÅ¿t men can Å¿peak for the opening of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb facs="tcp:169451:16"/>
muÅ¿t be reÅ¿olved into Scripture, before it can ground faith and Å¿atisfie conÅ¿cience, which is the drift of this CatechiÅ¿me, wherewith thou mayeÅ¿t expect a bleÅ¿Å¿ing, if thou Å¿halt pray, read, and Å¿tudy the anÅ¿wers; wherein I have not been Å¿o carefull, to give you the forme of an anÅ¿wer; as to referre you to Å¿uch Scriptures as afford matter for the AnÅ¿wer: which courÅ¿e I finde warranted by the like pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our Saviour, and I judge it the profitableÅ¿t way in a Tractate in this nature; for thereby the Reader will be conÅ¿trained to Å¿tudy the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to underÅ¿tand the force of them, before he can Å¿atisfie himÅ¿elfe with an anÅ¿wer from them: as for example, in the queÅ¿tion concerning BaptiÅ¿me, the Reader muÅ¿t weigh the circumÅ¿tances of the text, and compare it with the History in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and Å¿o he may be enabled to Å¿atisfie himÅ¿elfe in forming an AnÅ¿wer thus, All the IÅ¿raelites preÅ¿ently after their coming forth from <hi>Egypt,</hi> when many of them were little children, were Baptized by the cloud which hung over their heads.
